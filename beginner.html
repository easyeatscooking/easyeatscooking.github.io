		<h2>Pesto Chicken and Vegetables</h2>
		<img src="images/b1.png" alt="Pesto Chicken and Vegetables width="250" height="140">
	<p>Ingredients</p> 
	<ul>
		1 red bell pepper<br>
		1 zucchini<br>
		1 yellow squash<br>
		1/2 red onion<br>
		1.3 lbs. boneless, skinless chicken breast<br>
		2 Tbsp cooking oil <br>
		1 cup frozen green beans<br>
		1/3 cup pesto<br>
		1/8 tsp salt<br>
		1/8 tsp freshly cracked pepper<br>
		1 Tbsp grated Parmesan<br>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Directions</p>
	<ol>

		<li>Cube the chicken breasts into ½-inch pieces.</li>
		<li>Add the cooking oil to a large skillet and heat over medium-high. Once the skillet and oil are very hot, add the chicken and sauté until the chicken pieces are opaque (3-5 minutes – the chicken will continue to cook as you add vegetables). Add the green beans to the skillet and sauté for 1-2 minutes.</li>
		<li>Add the bell pepper and red onion to the skillet. Sauté for 1-2 minutes.</li>
		<li>Add the yellow squash and zucchini to the skillet and continue to sauté.</li>
		<li>Turn the heat off, add the pesto to the skillet, and stir until everything is coated. Give the vegetables a taste and add salt, pepper, or more pesto if desired. Top with a light sprinkle of Parmesan just before serving.</li>
